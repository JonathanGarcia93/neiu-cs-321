1. ## Application Name: 
    Real Estate Calculator
2. ## Project Topic/Objective:
    My web application would be a collection of calculators useful for people purchasing homes for multiple reasons. Users would be able to calculate mortgages, refinancing, down payments, rental income. Maybe also allow the ability to store their cost and income of people’s real estate portfolios so they can have an online place to be able to reach their data. Users will be able to log in and store their calculations for they can refer to them again without inputting data all over again every time.
3. ## Motivation:
    I want to build this application because at the moment I am a property manager. I been interested in investing in real estate after I graduate and save some money to buy in. Managing properties is not difficult and personally I don’t mind addressing tenant issues as some people do. So I am motivated to building an app that I would use myself and possibly others as well. I also have a life long project planned in my head of maintaining a website that host advice and calculators for people interested in real estate.
4. ## Server-Side Components
    Information that would be stored: Usernames, passwords, calulations and rental property finances.
